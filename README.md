# MediChain — Healthcare SaaS (Skeleton)

This repository is a starter skeleton for **MediChain** — a HIPAA-conscious healthcare SaaS that manages patient records with blockchain anchoring, telemedicine, billing/insurance automation, and AI-powered suggestions.

**What is included**
- Minimal Laravel-like backend skeleton (files + sample migrations)
- React + TypeScript frontend skeleton (Vite)
- Docker + docker-compose for local dev
- Kubernetes manifests (example)
- Smart contract (Solidity) anchor example
- Seed data and sample credentials

**Sample admin credentials (demo only):**
- Email: `admin@medichain.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`

## How to use
This is a skeleton — to run a real system you must install dependencies (Composer, PHP, Node.js), configure environment variables, and implement service logic.
